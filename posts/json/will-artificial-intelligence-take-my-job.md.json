James Wilson, Managing Director, Accenture Research, a team of radiologists and pathologists recently created an AI based technique that identifies 99.5% of cancer cells; that translates to 130,000 more woman receiving accurate breast cancer diagnoses.\n\nAI isn\u2019t coming to take over your job, but to enhance it. With that in mind then, how will AI enhance YOUR job? and just what new kinds of jobs will AI create?\n\n[![What new kinds of jobs will AI create? H.

I agree.\n\nBut that\u2019s looking at a single pixel in a much bigger picture. That\u2019s the thinking of an employer who says \u201chow can we get rid of X amount of \u2018resources\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe employer has the option to drop employees or empower them.\n\nA good employer will choose to empower. After all, roles can change over time, while a driver (personal, taxi, etc.) today may only handle the repetitive task of taking a passenger from point A to point B, in the future the job may very well evolve into \u2018training\u2019 or \u2018evaluating\u2019 autonomous vehicles. If an employer chooses not to empower their employees, in my opinion, that isn\u2019t AI taking your job, that\u2019s an employer taking your job.\n\nWhat do you think?"}
