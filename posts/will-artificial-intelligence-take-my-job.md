# Will artificial intelligence take my job?

What happens when humans and machines combine forces?

According to H. James Wilson, Managing Director, Accenture Research, a team of radiologists and pathologists recently created an AI based technique that identifies 99.5% of cancer cells; that translates to 130,000 more woman receiving accurate breast cancer diagnoses.

AI isn’t coming to take over your job, but to enhance it. With that in mind then, how will AI enhance YOUR job? and just what new kinds of jobs will AI create?

But – **_some can be replaced, right?_**

Translators, interpreters, machinery inspectors, cashiers, call center employees, paralegals – these jobs **_sure do seem_** like they can be replaced.

Looking at the main functions of these jobs, they can easily be broken down into core facets of machine learning – computer vision, analysis, decision making, speech, language processing, etc. It won’t be long until a machine can take an order nearly as well as a McDonalds employee can. I agree.

But that’s looking at a single pixel in a much bigger picture. That’s the thinking of an employer who says “how can we get rid of X amount of ‘resources’.”

The employer has the option to drop employees or empower them.

A good employer will choose to empower. After all, roles can change over time, while a driver (personal, taxi, etc.) today may only handle the repetitive task of taking a passenger from point A to point B, in the future the job may very well evolve into ‘training’ or ‘evaluating’ autonomous vehicles. If an employer chooses not to empower their employees, in my opinion, that isn’t AI taking your job, that’s an employer taking your job.

What do you think?
