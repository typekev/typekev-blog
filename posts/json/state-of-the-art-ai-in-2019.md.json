Now, this of course means that, as in all fields, the most useful advancements in AI will generally go unappreciated by most people.\n\nFor instance, when the topic is raised, often the focus falls on the end result; \u201cdid you hear about that new AI that can do\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t all bad (it\u2019s awesome to hear that people are excited for AI after all), I think that some of the other advancements in the field deserve a little more attention (I\u2019m looking at you, Transfer Learning.)\n\nSo I wanted to share this interesting video offering a top-level overview of Artificial (General) Intelligence as of 2019\\. The video aims to highlight what is currently considered \u201cstate of the art\u201d, as well as the frontiers we are currently breaching (such as Explainable AI, which is currently very interesting to Microsoft and some other big players). The video also discusses what advancements might be made in the near (or far) future.\n\nIt gave me some new talking points that I will use to draw attention to advancements that are important to me, and I hope it can do the same for you.\n\n[![AI/AGI - state of the art in 2019](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZusjVvxEinw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZusjVvxEinw)"}
