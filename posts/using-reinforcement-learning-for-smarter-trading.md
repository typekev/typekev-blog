# Using Reinforcement Learning for smarter trading

Trading is yet another field that is being transformed by artificial intelligence.

Extremely complex tasks – such as trading – have long been thought to be impossible for machines to perform. One big hurdle being just how to “teach” a machine to solve a problem without having an analytic solution to said problem. That is until recent advancements in reinforcement learning proved this to be a non-issue (I’d be happy to teach you more about building reinforcement learning models if you’re interested, learn more here: https://training.devoteam.lu/catalog/microsoft/artificialintelligence/aia-1).

Take a deep dive into TensorTrade: an open source reinforcement learning framework for training, evaluating, and deploying robust trading agents, with Adam King in his article [“Trade and Invest Smarter — The Reinforcement Learning Way”](https://towardsdatascience.com/trade-smarter-w-reinforcement-learning-a5e91163f315).
