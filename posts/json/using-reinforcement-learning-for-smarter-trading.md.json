One big hurdle being just how to \u201cteach\u201d a machine to solve a problem without having an analytic solution to said problem. That is until recent advancements in reinforcement learning proved this to be a non-issue (I\u2019d be happy to teach you more about building reinforcement learning models if you\u2019re interested, learn more here: https://training.devoteam.lu/catalog/microsoft/artificialintelligence/aia-1).\n\nTake a deep dive into TensorTrade: an open source reinforcement learning framework for training, evaluating, and deploying robust trading agents, with Adam King in his article [\u201cTrade and Invest Smarter \u2014 The Reinforcement Learning Way\u201d](https://towardsdatascience.com/trade-smarter-w-reinforcement-learning-a5e91163f315)."}
